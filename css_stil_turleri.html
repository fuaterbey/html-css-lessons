          Healthy food is delicious. Doing sport is enjoyable. You just need to
          start - people said. Nonsense! - I thought. To me, a 19-year-old guy,
          overweight and depressed, who ate tons of junk food to seize the
          stress, those healthy-life-gurus sounded like aliens coming from
          another planet. On their planet, it must have sounded right. On my
          planet, eating pizza was OK and jogging was exhausting. 12 years
          later, after I shed almost 100 pounds and completely changed my diet,
          I still believe we WERE on different planets. The thing is that once I
          escaped.
